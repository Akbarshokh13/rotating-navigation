            <p>Health is a state of wellbeing. It reflects the complex interactions of a persons genetics, lifestyle and environment. Generally, a persons health depends on two things: 
            determinants (factors that influence health) and interventions (actions taken to improve health, and the resources required for these interventions)..</p>
        <h3>Health</h3>

       <p>Eat a balanced diet: A balanced diet is essential for good health. It should include a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean protein, and healthy fats. Limiting processed foods, sugar, and saturated fats can help prevent chronic diseases and promote overall health.

        Exercise regularly: Regular exercise is important for maintaining good health. Physical activity helps reduce the risk of chronic diseases, improves mental health, and helps maintain a healthy weight. Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate physical activity most days of the week.
        
        Get enough sleep: Adequate sleep is essential for good health. A lack of sleep can lead to a range of health problems, including weight gain, depression, and weakened immunity. Aim for 7 to 8 hours of sleep each night.
        
        Manage stress: Chronic stress can have a negative impact on our health, causing physical and mental health problems. Finding healthy ways to manage stress, such as through exercise, meditation, or talking to friends and family, can help maintain good health.
        
        Avoid unhealthy habits: Unhealthy habits, such as smoking and excessive drinking, can have a negative impact on our health. Quitting smoking and limiting alcohol consumption can help improve our overall health.</p>
